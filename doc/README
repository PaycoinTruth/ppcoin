Intro
-----
PPCoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/ppcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/ppcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/ppcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/ppcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  PPCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the PPCoin network.


Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.3, first backup wallet
ppcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown ppcoind by
ppcoind stop
Uninstall v0.3 client, download and install v0.4 client.
Start up the new ppcoind (0.4.0).
If upgrade is performed after upgrade deadline then blockchain re-download
is required.

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

About Paycoin
---------------
Paycoin is a Paycoin network-compatible, community-developed wallet client.

The project has been designed to provide people with a
stable, secure, and feature-rich alternative to the Paycoin reference
wallet (http://github.com/paycoin/paycoin). 

To help faciliate broad community cooperation, a number of trusted 
Paycoin/Peershares community leaders have write permissions to the project's 
codebase, allowing for decentralization and continuity. Community members, 
old and new, are encouraged to find ways to contribute to the success of 
the project. If you have experience with programming, product design, 
QA engineering, translation, or have a different set of skills that you want to 
bring to the project, your involvement is appreciated!


Development Roadmap
-------------------
* Updated branding and wallet design
* Integrated support for multiple Peershares offerings
* An improved minting experience
